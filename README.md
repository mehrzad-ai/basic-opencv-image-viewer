# basic-opencv-image-viewer
A beginner-level OpenCV project to load and display images with basic color conversion.


# Basic OpenCV Image Viewer

This is a beginner-friendly computer vision project demonstrating how to load and display an image using OpenCV and Matplotlib in Python.

## 📷 Project Goal

To practice basic image input/output operations using OpenCV, including:
- Loading an image from disk
- Displaying it using OpenCV and Matplotlib
- Converting image color from BGR to RGB

## 🖼️ Input Image

The image file `img1.jpg` is used as the input. Make sure it's placed in the same directory as the notebook.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (cv2)  
- Matplotlib  

## 📁 Files

- `j3-opencv.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook
- `img1.jpg`: Sample input image

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm exploring basic computer vision concepts using OpenCV. This repository is part of my learning journey.
